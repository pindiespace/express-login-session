### Basic Session Login

This project illustrates a basic login with session support in ExpressJS 4.x.

It is not a full-featured login system, and it does not connect to an authentication database.

## Installation

Run npm install for most of the required libraries.

Separately run npm install nodemon -g for the node demon (needed for npm start).
